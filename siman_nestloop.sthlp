{it:options}]

{pstd}{it:performancemeasures} are any measures for which performance has been calculated by 
{help siman analyse}. See {help siman analyse##perfmeas:performance measures}.

{pstd}The {it:if} condition should usually apply only to {bf:dgm}, {bf:target} and {bf:method}, and not e.g. to 
{bf:repetition}. A warning is issued if this is breached.

{syntab:Options controlling the main graph}
{synopt:{opt dgmo:rder(string)}}defines the order of data generating mechanism (DGM) variables for the nested-loop 
plot. The right-most variable is fastest-changing. A 
negative sign in front of the variable name 
will sort its values on the graph in descending order.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt stag:ger(#)}}horizontally staggers the lines for different methods.  Default # is 0. Try 
{cmd:stagger(0.05)} to make overlapping lines more distinct.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt c:onnect(string)}}controls how the main graph and descriptor graph are connected. 
Default is {cmd:connect(stairstep)}, which shows each performance statistic as a horizontal line with 
vertical joins (as described by {help siman nestloop##ruckerschwarzer:Rücker and Schwarzer, 2014}). 
An alternative is {cmd:connect(ascending)}, which connects performance statistics with diagonal lines.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt noref:line}}suppresses display of reference lines for certain performance measures 
(coverage, bias, relprec and relerror).{p_end}

{syntab:Options controlling the descriptor graph}
{synopt:{opt dgsi:ze(#)}}defines the vertical size of the descriptor graph, as a fraction of the 
whole vertical axis.  Default # is 0.35.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt dgga:p(#)}}defines the vertical size of the gap between the main graph and the descriptor 
graph, as a fraction of the whole vertical axis.  Default # is 0.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt dgin:nergap(#)}}controls the vertical spacing between the  descriptor graphs.  Default # is 3.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt dgco:lor(string)}}controls the colour(s) for the descriptor graphs and their labels. Default is gs4.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt dgpa:ttern(string)}}controls the pattern(s) for descriptor graph. Default is solid.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt dgla:bsize(string)}}controls the size of the descriptor graph labels. Default is vsmall.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt dgst:yle(string)}}controls the style(s) of the descriptor graph.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt dglw:idth(string)}}controls the line width(s) of the descriptor graph.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt dgre:verse}}reverses the order of the descriptor graphs, so that the slowest-changing 
(left-most) DGM variable is shown at the top. By default, the slowest-changing DGM variable is shown 
at the bottom.{p_end}

{syntab:Other graph options}
{synopt:{opt methleg:end}{cmd:(item|title)}}includes the name of the method variable in each legend 
item or as the legend title. The default is neither.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt scena:riolabel}}labels the horizontal axis with scenario numbers. 
The default is an unlabelled axis, since the descriptor graphs describe the scenarios.{p_end}
{synopt:{it:graph_options}}Most of the valid options for {help line:line} are available.
We find these especially useful: {cmd:ylabel()} to stop the y-labels extending to the descriptor graph; 
{cmd:legend()} to arrange legends in a single row or column, e.g.
{cmd:legend(pos(6) row(1))} or {cmd:legend(pos(3) col(1))}.{p_end}

{syntab:Saving options}
{synopt:{opt name}({it:namestub}[{cmd:, replace}])}the stub for the graph name, to which "_", the target name, 
"_" and the performance measure are appended. Default is "nestloop". For example, 
with two targets, beta and gamma, and two performance measures, bias and relerror, default graph 
names would be "nestloop_beta_bias", "nestloop_gamma_bias", "nestloop_beta_relerror" and "nestloop_gamma_relerror".{p_end}
{synopt:{opt sav:ing}({it:namestub}[{cmd:, replace}])}saves each graph to disk in Stata’s .gph format.
The graph name is {it:namestub}, to which "_", the target name, 
"_" and the performance measure are appended. Default is "nestloop". {p_end}
{synopt:{opt exp:ort}({it:filetype}[{cmd:, replace}])}exports each graph to disk in non-Stata format. 
{cmd:saving()} must also be specified. Each exported file name is the same as for {cmd:saving()} with the appropriate 
filetype, which must be one of the suffices listed in {help graph export}.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt pause}}pauses before drawing each graph, if {help pause} is on. The user can 
press F9 to view the graph command, and may edit it to create more customised graphs.{p_end}
{synoptline}


{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:siman nestloop} draws a nested-loop plot of performance statistics ({help siman nestloop##ruckerschwarzer:Rücker and Schwarzer, 2014}). One
graph is drawn for each combination of target and performance measure. Each
graph presents the simulation results for all data-generating mechanisms and all methods in one plot. 

{pstd}
The performance measure is split by method and is stacked according to the levels of the data 
generating mechanisms along the horizontal
axis. The nested-loop plot loops through nested data-generating mechanisms and plots results 
for different methods on top of each other in a full factorial design.

{pstd}The user can select a set of performance measures to be graphed from those listed in 
{help siman analyse##perfmeas:performance measures}.
If no performance measures are specified, then the default choice is {help siman analyse##bias:bias};
however, if {cmd:true()} was not specified in {help siman setup}, graphs will be drawn for 
{help siman analyse##mean:mean}.

{pstd}
The user can specify {it:if} within the {cmd:siman nestloop} syntax. The
{it:if} condition should only apply to {bf:dgm}, {bf:target} and {bf:method}; if
the condition is applied to other variables, an error "no observations" is likely.

{pstd}
We recommend to sort the simulation dataset in such a way that the simulation parameter with the largest influence on the criterion 
of interest is considered first, and so forth.  Further guidance can be found in {help siman nestloop##ruckerschwarzer:Rücker and Schwarzer, 2014}.

{pstd}
Both {help siman setup} and {help siman analyse} need to be run before {bf:siman nestloop} can be used.
