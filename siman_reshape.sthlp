{phang}
{bf:siman reshape} {hline 2} is an undocumented utility command that reshapes ‘siman set’ data as required for graphs.

{marker syntax}{...}
{title:Syntax}

{phang}
Input data can be either reshaped to long-long format (i.e. long targets, long methods) or long-wide format (i.e. long targets, wide methods) using:

{phang}
siman reshape, longlong

{phang}
siman reshape, longwide

{pstd}
{p_end}

{pstd}
siman reshape takes the data imported from {bf:{help siman_setup:siman setup}} and either reshapes it in to long-long format or long-wide format.
Please note that {bf:{help siman_setup:siman setup}} will automatically reshape wide-target data (i.e. wide targets, wide methods) or wide-long format data
(i.e. wide targets, long methods) into long-wide format.  Also note that {bf: siman reshape} uses the in-built {bf:{help reshape:reshape}} command, which has a known limitation of dropping the labels of numeric variables upon reshape 
in Stata versions 18 and lower.

{pstd}
The reshaped data set is held in memory.  There is also an auto-summary output available for the user to confirm the data set 
up (using  {bf:{help siman_describe:siman describe}}).
